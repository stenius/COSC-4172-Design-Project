Describe how to generate a random vaiate from the distribution function:
	f(x) = 1/10 
	& -4 <= x <= 6

Describe how to generate a random vaiate from the distribution function:
	f(x) =  3/7 x**2
	& 1 <= x <= 2

Suppose a random vairable %Chi has the following distribution function:
	x	2	5	7	9	10
	f(x) 	0.2 	0.2 	0.2 	0.3 	0.1

a) Plot the cumulative distribution of %Chi.
b) What value of %Chi corresponds to the uniform variate (on the interval
[0,1]), 0.68?
