Senior Seminar course project

Customers visit some kind of store and get a service number and are fed into
one a checkout lane.  Some times the customers are dissatisfied and they need
to be helped a second time.

This simulation was written to determine weather having a priority queue for
dissatisfied customers will improve the throughput of the store.
